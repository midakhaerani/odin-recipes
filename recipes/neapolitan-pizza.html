  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Neapolitan pizza is a classic Italian pizza known for its soft, airy crust, thin center, and simple, high-quality ingredients. Originating from Naples, it is traditionally baked at very high temperatures, which creates a lightly charred exterior while keeping the inside tender and moist.
  </p>
  <p>
    This pizza focuses on balance and restraint: a naturally fermented dough, bright San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and extra-virgin olive oil. When done correctly, each bite highlights the flavor of the dough as much as the toppings.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tipo 00 flour</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Sea salt</li>
    <li>Fresh yeast or instant dry yeast</li>
    <li>San Marzano tomatoes (crushed)</li>
    <li>Fresh mozzarella (preferably mozzarella di bufala)</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix water and yeast until dissolved, then gradually add flour and salt to form a soft dough.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, then let it rest and ferment at room temperature until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into individual balls and allow them to rest again until relaxed and airy.</li>
    <li>Crush the tomatoes by hand and season lightly with salt.</li>
    <li>Stretch each dough ball gently into a thin round, leaving a thicker edge for the crust.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, add sliced mozzarella, and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Bake in a very hot oven or pizza oven until the crust puffs, blisters, and develops light charring.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, garnish with fresh basil, and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
