  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Spaghetti Alfredo is a rich and comforting Italian-American pasta dish known for its creamy, buttery sauce. The sauce coats long strands of spaghetti, creating a smooth and indulgent texture with every bite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Traditionally made with simple ingredients, Alfredo sauce relies on the combination of butter, cream, and cheese to create its signature flavor. It can be enjoyed on its own or enhanced with additions like grilled chicken, shrimp, or vegetables.
