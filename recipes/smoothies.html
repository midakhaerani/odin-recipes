  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Smoothies are a quick, refreshing, and nutritious drink made by blending fruits, liquids, and optional add-ins into a smooth consistency. They are popular for breakfast, post-workout recovery, or as a light snack because they are easy to customize and fast to prepare.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on the ingredients, smoothies can be energizing, protein-rich, or hydrating. Using fresh or frozen fruits allows you to control sweetness naturally while adding yogurt, milk, or plant-based alternatives for creaminess.
